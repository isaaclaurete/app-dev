## **Kimi no Na wa / Your Name**
Description: Two teenagers share a profound, magical connection upon discovering they are swapping bodies. Things manage to become even more complicated when the boy and girl decide to meet in person.

### **Why is it my favorite?**
Just cause, I like the *red string of fate* theory. Symbolizes that, it connects someone you are fated to, according to Japanese tradition. I always think about who is the person I was fated with, someone I had *red string of fate*. Anyways...

#### **Fun fact**
I watched this movie at least thrice.
1. Grade 9 (2017)
2. Grade 10 (2018)
3. One summer vacation (n.d) *I forgot when*
